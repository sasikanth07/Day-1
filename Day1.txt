1)Difference between http1.1 vs http2:

        *HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. By using HTTP 
    user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. There are several stages of 
    development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 
    which was created in 2015.

    HTTP 1.1:
        *It works on the textual format.
        *There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
        *It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
        *It compresses data by itself.

    HTTP 2 :
        *It works on the binary protocol.
        *HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP(Transmission control protocol) connection to send multiple streams of 
    data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
        *It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
        *It uses HPACK for data compression.

2)Blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript:

        *In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties.
        *A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their                                 characteristics.
    creating objects in JS:
        *Literally we can create object in javascript and also we can create object by creaing instance(using keyword).\
    
    Synat:
            object={ 
                    property1:value1,
                    property2:value2,
                    property3:value3
                }
    example:
            var person={ 
                        "name": "lavish",
                        "age":  28
                    }
    instance creation synatx below:
            var objectname=new objext();
    example:
            var emp=new Object();
            emp.id=1;
            emp.name="XXX";
            emp.salery=25000;
    we can acces javascript object by using below :
            objectName.property
            objectName["property"]
